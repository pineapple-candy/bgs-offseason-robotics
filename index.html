            <span class = "bgs_blue">Brisbane Grammar School Robotics</span> has been competing in FTC, <i>First Tech Challenge</i>, since its inaugral years in 2018. FTC is a yearly competition where 
            alliances of two teams must compete against eachother to score more points in tasks. In previous years, this looked like shooting balls called <b>artifacts</b> 
            to delivering rubber duckies. The purpose of offseason is large, but it is an opportunity to:
            <ul class = "code_font">
                <li>Develop skills required for the selective <b>main season</b></li>
                <li>Foster <b>interest in Robotics</b> and begin to understand the competition and Gracious Professionalism (whoo!)</li>
                <li>Have fun! (and win)</li>

        <h1>The Offseason Game</h1>
        <h2>
            The offseason game is a custom, tailored 'game' that our robots compete in the offseason, created by Robotics Coordinator Mr. Ellis. 
            They are meant to simulate real FTC games and structure. As such, there are multiple offseason teams that will build different robots and 
            compete near the end of Term 3. After this, <b>around ~16 people</b> will be chosen to compete in the main season of FTC, in two teams <b>(#19450 and #14579)</b>
            You can see, below, a brief timeline of the main season, as well as a flowchart. Previous seasons are in the <a href="#" class="hyperlink">History</a> page.

            In terms of game structure, there are two phases in a match:
            <ul class = "code_font">
                <li><b>Autonomous (30s):</b> Every action is performed without input from drivers. The robot must move by itself to perform tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Teleop:</b> Drivers may use controllers to drive the robot.</li>
            </ul>
            The winner is the alliance, comprised of two random teams, who scores the most amount of points from both phases, combined!

            how the 'game' actually works, and the spirit of FIRST robotics!
